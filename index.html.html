<p>Tirone José González Orama (March 11, 1988 – January 19, 2015), known by his stage name Canserbero, was a Venezuelan rapper, considered
     one of the most significant exponents of independent rap in his country and in the rest of Latin America.

    Since he was young, he showed interest in music, mainly influenced by reggaeton but, after the murder of his half brother, 
    his musical references changed to more critical genres such as hip hop and hard rock, appreciable in songs like "Es épico".
    
    Canserbero, throughout his career, released two studio albums as a soloist, Vida (2010) and Muerte (2012) respectively, 
    and had several notorious songs such as "Pensando en ti", "Es épico", "C'est la mort", "Maquiavélico", among others. He also 
    participated as a vocalist in several songs of artists from Latin America and Spain as Mala Rodríguez, with whom he recorded a song 
    entitled "Ella" (2013). In January 2015, Canserbero was found dead after having fallen from an apartment in Maracay. There are several 
    hypotheses about his death.</p>
